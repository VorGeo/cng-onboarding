    "text": "The Planetary Computer catalogs the datasets we host using the STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) specification. We provide a STAC API endpoint that can be used to search our datasets by space, time, and more. This quickstart will show you how to search for data using our STAC API and open-source Python libraries. For more on how to use our STAC API from R, see Reading data from the STAC API with R.\nFirst we’ll use pystac-client to open up our STAC API:\n\nfrom pystac_client import Client\n\ncatalog = Client.open(\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1\")\n\n\nSearching\nWe can use the STAC API to search for assets meeting some criteria. This might include the date and time the asset covers, is spatial extent, or any other property captured in the STAC item’s metadata.\nIn this example we’ll search for imagery from Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 area around Microsoft’s main campus in December of 2020.\n\ntime_range = \"2020-12-01/2020-12-31\"\nbbox = [-122.2751, 47.5469, -121.9613, 47.7458]\n\nsearch = catalog.search(collections=[\"landsat-8-c2-l2\"], bbox=bbox, datetime=time_range)\nitems = search.get_all_items()\nlen(items)\n\n/Users/tylere/Documents/GitHub/VorGeo/stac-onboarding/tutorials/stac/mspc_stac/.pixi/envs/default/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pystac_client/item_search.py:896: FutureWarning: get_all_items() is deprecated, use item_collection() instead.\n  warnings.warn(\n\n\n4\n\n\nIn that example our spatial query used a bounding box with a bbox. Alternatively, you can pass a GeoJSON object as intersects\narea_of_interest = {\n    \"type\": \"Polygon\",\n    \"coordinates\": [\n        [\n            [-122.2751, 47.5469],\n            [-121.9613, 47.9613],\n            [-121.9613, 47.9613],\n            [-122.2751, 47.9613],\n            [-122.2751, 47.5469],\n        ]\n    ],\n}\n\ntime_range = \"2020-12-01/2020-12-31\"\n\nsearch = catalog.search(\n    collections=[\"landsat-8-c2-l2\"], intersects=area_of_interest, datetime=time_range\n)\nitems is a pystac.ItemCollection. We can see that 4 items matched our search criteria.\n\nlen(items)\n\n4\n\n\nEach pystac.Item in this ItemCollection includes all the metadata for that scene. STAC Items are GeoJSON features, and so can be loaded by libraries like geopandas.\n\nimport geopandas\n\ndf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame.from_features(items.to_dict(), crs=\"epsg:4326\")\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeometry\ndatetime\nplatform\nproj:bbox\ndescription\ninstruments\neo:cloud_cover\nview:off_nadir\nlandsat:wrs_row\nlandsat:scene_id\nlandsat:wrs_path\nlandsat:wrs_type\nview:sun_azimuth\nview:sun_elevation\nlandsat:cloud_cover_land\nlandsat:processing_level\nlandsat:collection_number\nlandsat:collection_category\nproj:code\n\n\n\n\n0\nPOLYGON ((-122.74802 48.51223, -120.22983 48.0...\n2020-12-29T18:55:56.738265Z\nlandsat-8\n[471585.0, 5136885.0, 705015.0, 5373315.0]\nLandsat Collection 2 Level-2 Surface Reflectan...\n[oli, tirs]\n100.00\n0\n027\nLC80460272020364LGN00\n046\n2\n162.253231\n17.458298\n100.00\nL2SP\n02\nT2\nEPSG:32610\n\n\n1\nPOLYGON ((-124.29833 48.51325, -121.79248 48.0...\n2020-12-20T19:02:09.878796Z\nlandsat-8\n[353385.0, 5135085.0, 589215.0, 5374215.0]\nLandsat Collection 2 Level-2 Surface Reflectan...\n[oli, tirs]\n100.00\n0\n027\nLC80470272020355LGN00\n047\n2\n163.360118\n17.414441\n100.00\nL2SP\n02\nT2\nEPSG:32610\n\n\n2\nPOLYGON ((-122.75189 48.5119, -120.23406 48.09...\n2020-12-13T18:56:00.096447Z\nlandsat-8\n[471285.0, 5136885.0, 704715.0, 5373315.0]\nLandsat Collection 2 Level-2 Surface Reflectan...\n[oli, tirs]\n98.73\n0\n027\nLC80460272020348LGN00\n046\n2\n164.126188\n17.799744\n98.64\nL2SP\n02\nT2\nEPSG:32610\n\n\n3\nPOLYGON ((-124.29534 48.51347, -121.78981 48.0...\n2020-12-04T19:02:11.194486Z\nlandsat-8\n[353685.0, 5135085.0, 589515.0, 5374215.0]\nLandsat Collection 2 Level-2 Surface Reflectan...\n[oli, tirs]\n1.55\n0\n027\nLC80470272020339LGN00\n047\n2\n164.914060\n18.807230\n1.90\nL2SP\n02\nT1\nEPSG:32610\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the eo extension to sort the items by cloudiness.

We can access the raw data, stored as Cloud Optimzied GeoTIFFs in Azure Blob Storage, using one of the other assets. That said, we do need to do one more thing before accessing the data. If we simply made a request to the file in blob storage we’d get a 404:\n\nimport requests\n\nurl = selected_item.assets[\"SR_B2\"].href\nprint(\"Accessing\", url)\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nresponse\n\nAccessing https://landsateuwest.blob.core.windows.net/landsat-c2/level-2/standard/oli-tirs/2020/047/027/LC08_L2SP_047027_20201204_20210313_02_T1/LC08_L2SP_047027_20201204_20210313_02_T1_SR_B2.TIF\n\n\n&lt;Response [404]&gt;\n\n\nThat’s because the Plantary Computer uses Azure Blob Storage SAS Tokens to enable access to our data, which allows us to provide the data for free to anyone, anywhere while maintaining some control over the amount of egress for datasets.\nTo get a token for access, you can use the Planetary Computer’s Data Authentication API. You can access that anonymously, or you can provide an API Key for higher rate limits and longer-lived tokens.\nYou can also use the planetary-computer package to generate tokens and sign asset HREFs for access.

Because the Planetary Computer’s STAC API supports the query parameter, you can search on additional properties on the STAC item.\nFor example, collections like sentinel-2-l2a and landsat-8-c2-l2 both implement the eo STAC extension and include an eo:cloud_cover property. Use query={\"eo:cloud_cover\": {\"lt\": 20}} to return only items that are less than 20% cloudy.\n\ntime_range = \"2020-12-01/2020-12-31\"\nbbox = [-122.2751, 47.5469, -121.9613, 47.7458]\n\nsearch = catalog.search(\n    collections=[\"sentinel-2-l2a\"],\n    bbox=bbox,\n    datetime=time_range,\n    query={\"eo:cloud_cover\": {\"lt\": 20}},\n)\nitems = search.get_all_items()\n\n/Users/tylere/Documents/GitHub/VorGeo/stac-onboarding/tutorials/stac/mspc_stac/.pixi/envs/default/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pystac_client/item_search.py:896: FutureWarning: get_all_items() is deprecated, use item_collection() instead.\n  warnings.warn(\n\n\nOther common uses of the query parameter is to filter a collection down to items of a specific type, For example, the GOES-CMI collection includes images from various when the satellite is in various modes, which produces images of either the Full Disk of the earth, the continental United States, or a mesoscale.
